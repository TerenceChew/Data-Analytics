Scenario
---
The company, Cylistic, has launched a bike-share programm. Customers who purchase one-time or full-day pass are referred to as casual riders. Customers who subschribe to annual membership are considered as members.  

Cylistic's finance analysts have concluded that members are more profitable than casual riders. They believe that maximizing the number of members would be the key to future growth. Furthermore, instead of organizing marketing campaigns to attract new customers, the analysts believe that there is a high probabilty to convert casual riders into members as they are already aware of the programm and have choosen it for their mobility needs.

Cylistic's primary objective is to design marketing strategies that focus on converting casual riders into members.
